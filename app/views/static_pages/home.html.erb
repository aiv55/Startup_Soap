	<h2>How it works</h2>
	<div id="how-wrapper">
		<h4>
			We provide structured mentorship for any startup that needs to take a hard look at their business model.
		</h4>
		<p>
			Whether you are preparing the apply to an accelerator, pitch to investors, or you've simply hit a plateau, we can help you identify red flags and refresh your focus so that you can move forward with confidence.
		</p>
		<h3>1 Week of Preparation</h3>
		<p>We will help you break down your business model into it's key elements.</p>
		<div class="info">
			<p>
				Your first step will be to fill out a Google Form by answering questions about your business. We will then use your answers to create a <a href="https://www.ziqquforge.com/">Ziqqu Forge</a> "story". This means that each assertion of your business model will get it's own webpage where you can attach evidence to back it up or comment on it. We will help you get started using Ziqqu Forge, and from there you may add more to your business model to prepare it for your mentor's first review.
			</p>

		<h3>4 Weeks of Mentorship</h3>
		<p>Experienced mentors at Fruition will analyse and critique your business model twice a week.</p>
		<div class="info">
			<p>
				You'll let us know which day's you want to be reviewed, and on those days your assigned mentor will go through your Ziqqu Forge profile and provide feedback. This feedback will always be tailored to point out the strengths and weaknesses your specific startup, but we generally structure our mentorship according the schedule below.
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					<h6>Week 1: Define the Foundation</h6>
					<p>
						Gather evidence to support your business model and make sure you have a strong grasp of your industry. How do you know that your startup fits where the industry is heading?

				</li>
				<li>
					<h6>Week 2: Create Value</h6>
					<p>
						Hone in on validating your value proposition. Do you understand what motivates your customers?
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<h6>Week 3: Focus your Execution Plan</h6>
					<p>
						Find out how to execute the simplest version of your product/service that can make money. What do you need to make your first sale or pre-sale?
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<h6>Week 4: Evaluate your Pitch and Offering</h6>
					<p>
						Bring everything together into a clear, compelling pitch. What questions will you have to answer before an investor is ready to make a deal?
					</p>
				</li>
			</ul>
		</div>
		<a class="more"></a>

		<h2>FAQ</h2>
		<div id="faq-wrapper">
			<ul>
				<li>
					<h3>What will I get out of this?</h3>
					<p>
						You will get a 4 weeks of structured feedback from an experienced startup mentor and a Ziqqu Forge profile that will keep track of all of your business model collaboration.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<h3>How much work is it?</h3>
					<p>
						We suggest that you set aside at least 10 hours a week for research and brainstorming between mentorship sessions. The mentor will review your business model twice a week, and you will be expected to have something new to show them each time. Whether you want to simply reply to their comments, or do extensive research and pivot your plan based on their suggestions, the effort you put in between each review is up to you and what you need to get out of this. 
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<h3>What if I don't agree with some of the feedback I get?</h3>
					<p>
						Start a healthy debate! Prove your point with evidence and a sound argument. Helping you get to what's important is the mentors job, and hashing things out is an important part of the process. However, if you ever feel like the quality of mentorship is not up to your standards, you can always cancel your membership and be refunded $62.50 for each week of leftover mentorship.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<h3>Can I invite others to help me?</h3>
					<p>
						Yes! Ziqqu Forge gives your business model an online profile that you can invite anyone to review.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<h3>What if I want a phone call or additional help?</h3>
					<p>
						Fruition also offers other mentorship services such as phone consultation. They even have an intense 3 month startup coaching program based on their <em><a href="http://fruitiontechlabs.com/fruition-technology-labs-process.html">5 Simple Steps to the Fruition Process â„¢</a></em>.

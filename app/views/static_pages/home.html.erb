	<div id="how-wrapper">
		<p>
			Want to join a startup accelerator or get funding from an angel investor? Our structured mentorship will help you identify and resolve any red flags in your business model so that you can move forward with confidence.
		</p>
		<h3>1 Week of Preparation</h3>
		<p>We will help you break down your business model into it's key elements.</p>
		<a class="more"></a>
		<div class="info">
			<p>
				Your first step will be to fill out a Google Form by answering questions about your business. We will then use your answers to create a <a href="https://www.ziqquforge.com/">Ziqqu Forge</a> "story". This means that each assertion of your business model will get it's own webpage where you can attach evidence to back it up or comment on it. We will help you get started using Ziqqu Forge, and from there you may add more to your business model to prepare it for your mentor's first review.
			</p>
		</div>
		<h3>4 Weeks of Mentorship</h3>
		<p>Mentors at Fruition will analyse and critique your business model twice a week.</p>

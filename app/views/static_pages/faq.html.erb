					How much work is it?
				</h3>
				<p>
					We suggest that you set aside at least 10 hours a week for research and brainstorming between mentorship sessions. 
					The mentor will review your business model twice a week, and you will be expected to have something new to show them each time. 
					Whether you want to simply reply to their comments, or do extensive research and pivot your plan based on their suggestions, the effort you put in between each review is up to you and what you need to get out of this.

				</h3>
				<p>
					Start a healthy debate! 
					Prove your point with evidence and a sound argument. 
					Helping you get to what's important is the mentors job, and hashing things out is an important part of the process. 
					However, if you ever feel like the quality of mentorship is not up to your standards, you can always cancel your membership and be refunded $62.50 for each week of leftover mentorship.

					Ziqqu Forge gives your business model an online profile that you can invite anyone to review.
